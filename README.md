# SwanMod

**SwanMod** is a Minecraft mod made by [LiteralSwan](https://www.youtube.com/@LiteralSwan) as part of an ongoing series on YouTube! In each episode, I take the top comment from the video and **add it to the mod** â€” no matter how ridiculous or cursed the suggestion may be â€” well... within reason.

Check out the series on my channel! [LiteralSwan on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LiteralSwan)
